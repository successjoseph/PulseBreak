🧠 Project Brief: PulseBreak

📝 1. Project Overview

PulseBreak is a cross-platform desktop application designed to improve health, focus, and accountability for individuals who spend extended periods working or studying in front of screens.

The app provides timely reminders, integrates voice-based affirmation checks, and includes intelligent Focus Mode and AFK detection to ensure that productivity and well-being are balanced seamlessly throughout the day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 2. Problem Statement

Many digital workers and students experience:

i. Eye strain and physical fatigue from prolonged screen exposure
ii. Forgetfulness around taking breaks or hydrating
iii. Decreased mental resilience due to lack of regular positive reinforcement
iv. Poor adherence to break reminders due to intrusive or simplistic tools
v. Existing reminder applications are often either too passive (easy to ignore) or too aggressive (disruptive), with little accountability or adaptability to real-world work patterns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💡 3. Proposed Solution

PulseBreak introduces a smart break and affirmation system that adapts to the user’s activity, focuses on gentle but consistent reminders, and uses voice confirmation to make sure affirmations are actually spoken.

The system includes manual Focus Mode, AFK detection, and system sleep awareness, ensuring reminders occur only at the right times — not during inactivity or intense work sessions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✨ 4. Core Features

a. ⏰ Scheduled Break Reminders

b. Customizable intervals (default: 20 minutes)

c. Notifications for:

    i. 20-20-20 Eye Rule
    ii. Hydration reminders
    iii. Standing & Stretching breaks
    iv. Delivered through native system notifications or subtle popups

d. 🗣 Mandatory Affirmations:

    i. Occur every 2 hours, regardless of Focus Mode status
    ii. Use microphone to confirm user has spoken, without storing audio
    iii. Non-compliance triggers gentle reminders
    iv. Logged for daily accountability

e. 🔴 Focus Mode:

    i. Activated manually through a floating always-on-top toggle box
    ii. Pauses all regular reminders while active
    iii. Affirmations continue to occur as scheduled

f. 💤 AFK Detection:
    i. Triggered after 5 minutes of no keyboard or mouse activity
    ii. All reminders (including affirmations) pause while AFK

g. If the system enters sleep mode:

    i. Focus Mode is automatically turned off
    ii. Schedules pause gracefully
    iii. On wake or activity resumption, reminders continue seamlessly

h. 🖥 Tray Integration & UI:

    i. Minimal system tray app
    ii. Floating focus toggle box for quick access
    iii. Settings and logs accessible via a clean Tauri-based UI
    iv. No intrusive overlays or unnecessary windows

i. 📝 Logs & Summaries:
    i. Tracks affirmation completion and skips, as well as reminders skipped due to Focus Mode
    ii. Keeps daily logs for 7 days
    iii. Automatically generates a weekly summary (averages and completion rates) at the end of each 7-day cycle
    iv. Deletes old daily logs after summarizing to keep storage lean

🧱 5. Technical Architecture

Component (Technology):	Purpose

Backend	(Python): Scheduling, AFK detection, mic checks, notifications
Scheduler (APScheduler):  Non-blocking recurring jobs
Notifications (Plyer / OS APIs): Cross-platform notification delivery
Voice Detection (vosk (local STT), pyaudio): Lightweight speech activity detection
AFK Detection (pyautogui / OS hooks): Detect inactivity and sleep events
Frontend (Tauri (Rust + HTML/JS)): Lightweight UI, tray integration, cross-platform support
Storage (JSON (MVP), SQLite (later)): Store settings and logs locally
Logging (JSON): Lightweight tracking of affirmation/reminder activity, summarized weekly

🌟 8. Value Proposition

Encourages healthy screen habits without being intrusive

Reinforces positive mindset through real spoken affirmations

Adapts intelligently to user behavior (Focus Mode & AFK detection)

Lightweight, privacy-respecting, and fully local — no external servers

Clean and minimal UX suitable for both students and professionals

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧭 9. Future Opportunities

Calendar and Pomodoro integration

Cloud sync of settings and logs

Custom affirmation libraries

Team/enterprise mode with usage dashboards

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📝 Conclusion

PulseBreak blends health, focus, and technology into a single, adaptive desktop companion. Through scheduled micro-breaks, mandatory spoken affirmations, and intelligent detection of user state, it encourages sustainable productivity without disrupting workflow.

This project leverages a simple but robust stack, making it ideal for solo development, future scalability, and cross-platform deployment.
