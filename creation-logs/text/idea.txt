🧠 Project Brief: PulseBreak (v2 - Mod)
📝 1. Project Overview

PulseBreak is a cross-platform desktop application designed to improve health, focus, and accountability. It intelligently monitors user-selected "work applications" to provide context-aware reminders.

The app is built around a system of Customizable User Modes (e.g., "At Work," "Studying," "Intense Focus"), each with its own unique set of reminders and actions. It features a minimal floating bubble UI for quick mode-switching and delivers actionable, screen-covering notifications (or subtle audio cues, depending on the mode) to ensure health and productivity are balanced.

🎯 2. Problem Statement

Many digital workers and students experience:

i. Eye strain and physical fatigue from prolonged screen exposure. ii. Forgetfulness around taking breaks or hydrating during focused work. iii. Decreased mental resilience due to a lack of positive reinforcement. iv. "Reminder Blindness": Existing tools are too passive and easily ignored. v. "Disruptive Reminders": Other tools are too aggressive, interrupting critical workflows (like a presentation or "flow state") with the wrong kind of alert. vi. Lack of Context: Tools don't differentiate between "deep work," "casual browsing," or "being in a meeting," treating all screen time identically.

💡 3. Proposed Solution

PulseBreak introduces a Mode-Based Wellness System that is triggered by Application Monitoring.

The user defines which applications (e.g., VS Code, Chrome, Word) count as "work." When these apps are active, PulseBreak runs the reminder schedule for the currently selected Mode.

Each Mode (e.g., "At Home," "Intense Focus," "In a Library") is fully customizable, allowing the user to define which reminders (posture, eye breaks, water) are active, how often they occur, and how they are delivered (e.g., a 70% screen popup, a gentle audio cue).

✨ 4. Core Features

a. 🖥️ Application Monitoring:

User selects a list of "work applications" that will trigger PulseBreak's active state.

Reminders only run when one of these designated applications is in the foreground.

b. 🎛️ Customizable User Modes:

Users can create and customize multiple modes (e.g., "At Home," "On Transit," "At Work," "Studying," "Intense Focus").

Each mode has its own settings for:

Active reminders (e.g., 20-20-20 rule, hydration, stretching, affirmations).

Reminder frequency.

Reminder delivery method (see below).

c. 🔊 Reminder Delivery System:

Standard (Popup): A large, semi-transparent popup that covers 70% of the screen, requiring dismissal or completion of the task (e.g., the affirmation). This is the default for most reminders.

Intense Focus (Audio): For modes like "Intense Focus," reminders are delivered as audio-only cues (e.g., a "posture" reminder) with no screen popup.

Mandatory Affirmations: Occur at their own interval (e.g., every 2 hours). Uses microphone confirmation. Delivery (popup vs. audio) is dependent on the active Mode.

d. 🔵 Floating UI & Side Tray:

A floating, always-on-top bubble is visible when the app is active.

Clicking the bubble expands it into a small side tray (similar to a phone's volume control).

This tray allows for instant switching between User Modes.

e. 💤 AFK & Sleep Detection:

Triggered after 5 minutes of no keyboard or mouse activity.

All reminders and tracking pause while AFK or if the system sleeps.

Schedules resume seamlessly on activity.

f. 📝 Logs & Summaries:

Tracks affirmation completion, skips, and reminders delivered.

Logs are categorized by Mode to see patterns (e.g., "Skipped 5 reminders while 'At Work'").

Generates a weekly summary of adherence and activity.

g. 🛠️ Heavy Customization:

The core philosophy: almost everything is customizable.

Users can define modes, edit reminders, change frequencies, and select app triggers.

🧱 5. Technical Architecture

Component (Technology): Purpose

Backend (Python):

Scheduling (APScheduler): Non-blocking recurring jobs for active modes.

Active Window Detection (pywin32 (Win), OS-specific APIs (Mac/Linux)): [New Challenge] Detects the foreground application to match against the user's "work app" list.

AFK Detection (pyautogui / OS hooks): Detect inactivity and sleep events.

Voice Detection (vosk, pyaudio): Lightweight, local speech activity detection.

Notifications (Tauri API / Plyer): Deliver audio cues. The 70% popup will be a borderless Tauri window.

Frontend (Tauri (Rust + HTML/JS)):

Main UI: Settings, mode creation, logs, app selection.

Floating Bubble: A small, transparent, always-on-top Tauri webview window.

Side Tray: The "expanded" state of the bubble window.

Popup Window: A large, borderless, semi-transparent Tauri window spawned for intrusive reminders.

Storage (JSON / SQLite):

settings.json: Stores app list, mode definitions, and preferences.

logs.json: Daily activity logs.

🛠 7. Development Timeline (Revised)

Phase | Goal | Deliverables --- | --- | --- Project Setup | Folder structure, dependencies. | Project skeleton created. Backend MVP | Core logic for modes and detection. | 1. Active Window Detection (to check for "work apps").


2. AFK detection.


3. Basic Mode logic (loading settings for a selected mode).


4. Scheduler that triggers placeholder reminders. Frontend MVP | The core UI/UX. | 1. Floating Bubble (always-on-top).


2. Side Tray that expands from bubble to switch modes.


3. Basic settings page to define a mode. Integration | Connect front and back ends. | 1. Bubble UI successfully tells backend which mode is active.


2. Backend scheduler triggers reminders based on the active mode.


3. Create the 70% (Tauri window) popup. Core Features | Add affirmations and audio. | 1. Integrate mic check for affirmations.


2. Implement audio-only reminders for "Intense Focus" mode. Polish | Logging, persistence, and QA. | 1. Implement logging. <B> 2. Build weekly summary.


3. Bug fixes.

Estimated MVP Completion: ~3-4 weeks (Note: The Active Window Detection is more complex than the original MVP).

🌟 8. Value Proposition

Truly Adaptive: Encourages healthy habits by adapting to the user's context and workflow, not just a simple timer.

Actionable Alerts: Overcomes "reminder blindness" with clear, configurable popups that demand attention when needed.

Protects Flow State: Allows users to define "Intense Focus" modes that protect deep work with subtle, non-visual cues.

Reinforces Mindset: Uses real, spoken affirmations to build mental resilience.

Lightweight & Private: Fully local, no external servers.

🧭 9. Future Opportunities

Calendar and Pomodoro integration (a "Pomodoro" could be a special "Mode").

Cloud sync of settings and modes.

Custom affirmation and audio libraries.

Team/enterprise mode with usage dashboards.

📝 Conclusion

PulseBreak (v2) evolves into a highly personal and intelligent wellness companion. By understanding what the user is doing (via app monitoring) and how they want to work (via modes), it delivers the right intervention at the right time, balancing productivity and well-being.
